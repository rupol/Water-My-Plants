# Water My Plants App

> Water My Plants helps users create a watering schedule to ensure all their plants are healthy and happy.

Building a schedule around ensuring that all your plants are watered is actually pretty difficult. Water my Plants helps to solve those problems by providing and easy to use interface for creating a plant watering schedule that will remind users to water their plants on a regular basis.

This is an app designed during a Lambda School build week.
